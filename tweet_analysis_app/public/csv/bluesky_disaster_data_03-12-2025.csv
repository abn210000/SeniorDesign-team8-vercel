The tsunami, triggered by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake off the northeastern coast of Honshu, surged through towns and cities, sweeping away vehicles, structures, and entire neighborhoods in mere seconds. The towering wave seen in the image looms over street signs and lampposts, dwarfing them with its unstoppable force. Whitecaps churn in the violent current, carrying wreckage from shattered homes and upturned vehicles. The \u201cMiyako\u201d sign on the roadside marks the area, a chilling reminder of the community that was nearly obliterated within moments. The Great East Japan Earthquake, the strongest recorded in the country\u2019s history, unleashed a tsunami that reached heights of over 40 meters (131 feet) in some areas. Miyako, like many towns along the T\u014dhoku coastline, was devastated beyond recognition. In the weeks and months that followed, residents returned to rebuild, but the scars of that day remain deeply etched into the landscape and collective memory of Japan.

A massive, frothy wave, resembling an advancing white wall, surges through a pine forest and bears down on homes and infrastructure. The trees in the foreground, previously a natural barrier, are no match for the raw power of the incoming water, which uproots everything in its path. Smoke and debris swirl in the background as the floodwaters overtake agricultural fields and residential areas. Sendai, a major city in the T\u014dhoku region, suffered extensive damage, with thousands of homes washed away and entire districts submerged. The tsunami\u2019s arrival, just minutes after the earthquake, left residents little time to flee, and many were caught in the devastating surge. Cars, houses, and industrial facilities were swept away, causing one of the deadliest natural disasters in Japan\u2019s history. In the aftermath, Japan launched a historic reconstruction effort, implementing strict building codes, elevated evacuation routes, and the construction of the world\u2019s most advanced tsunami defense infrastructure.

Once lined with homes, schools, and businesses, the landscape is now a barren, debris-strewn expanse, with little remaining of the structures that once stood. Roads crisscross through the destruction, but they are nearly unrecognizable amid the flattened remains of buildings. Rikuzentakata was among the hardest-hit areas, as the tsunami swept nearly the entire city away, leaving only a handful of buildings standing. Of its approximately 23,000 residents, nearly 2,000 lost their lives, and thousands more were displaced. The scale of destruction was so vast that rebuilding efforts took years, with entire districts relocated to higher ground to prevent future disasters. Among the most symbolic losses was the destruction of the Takata Matsubara pine forest, a beloved coastal landmark with over 70,000 trees, of which only a single pine remained standing after the waves receded.

A large fishing boat, once safely moored in the harbor, now rests eerily atop the rubble, a stark illustration of the sheer power of the waves that carried it inland. Utility poles lean precariously, their wires tangled amid the debris, while shattered glass, broken beams, and crushed vehicles fill the streets. Kesennuma, a town heavily reliant on its fishing industry, suffered immense losses, with many of its harbors and processing plants destroyed. Fires broke out in the aftermath of the tsunami, further compounding the destruction. In the years since, the town has worked tirelessly to rebuild, with new tsunami-resistant infrastructure and disaster evacuation procedures in place. This image remains one of the most widely recognized photographs of the disaster, a haunting testament to the power of nature and the resilience of those who survived.""}]"

However, the truth is, no landslide victory has occurred. None of the candidates even reached 50 percent of the votes. This is a disaster for the entire country. A landslide victory was what President Biden achieved in the 2020 election against Trump. A landslide victory was what Barack Obama did with John McCain. A landslide victory was seen in the race between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton also achieved a landslide victory against his opponents. In 2024, no landslide victory occurred. However, in 2028, a massive landslide in favor of the Democrat Party might happen, unless the Democrat Party chooses to lose again. Unfortunately, the Democrat Party has become an expert at losing to itself.

All severe\nhazards are possible, including swaths of intense winds and\ntornadoes.\n\n...MS/Lower OH/TN Valleys...\n\nA large cyclone will rapidly intensify as it lifts northeast across\nthe central Plains to the Upper Midwest on Friday. A 100+ kt\nsouthwesterly jet streak at 500 mb will overspread portions of the\nOzarks/Mid-MS Valley, while a 60-70 kt low-level jet overspreads\nmuch the Mid-South and Mid-MS/Lower OH Valleys during the late\nafternoon into the overnight hours. Northward extent of deeper Gulf\nmoisture (60s F dewpoints) will likely remain south of southeast\nMO/southern IL/western KY, with more modest 50s F dewpoints\nexpanding northward into southeast MN/southern WI and eastward\ntoward the Lower OH Valley. Despite the more modest moisture across\nthe northern half of the outlook area, cold temperatures aloft will\nsupport steep midlevel lapse rates and at least weak instability. \n\nA strongly forced QLCS is expected to develop along a surface\ndryline as the mid/upper jet impinges on the Ozarks vicinity by late\nafternoon or early evening. Intense forcing and deep-layer wind\nfields will maintain an organized QLCS into the nighttime hours.\nStrong daytime heating and mixing of the boundary layer ahead of the\nQLCS will further promote swaths of severe/damaging gusts, some of\nwhich may be greater than 65 kt. While moisture will be somewhat of\na limiting factor, QLCS tornadoes also will be possible.\n\nConvection may develop later across AR into the TN Valley/Deep\nSouth. However, deeper Gulf moisture will be in place across this\nregion (possible mid/upper 60s F). This will support stronger\ninstability amid supercell wind profiles. Large-scale ascent will be\nmore subtle across this area, but sharpening of the dryline across\nAR and low-level confluence should support convective development\nduring the evening. Initial supercells may grow upscale into a line\nmoving across portions of AR/TN/northern MS/AL. An attendant risk of\nstrong tornadoes and swaths of damaging/potentially significant wind\ngusts is expected across the Mid-South with this activity.\n\nA more conditional risk for overnight supercells exists across parts\nnorthern/central MS/AL. The environment could support intense\nsupercells capable of producing large hail and strong tornadoes this\nfar south, but forcing mechanisms will be weak. Trends will be\nmonitored and future outlook adjustments may be needed.\n\n..Leitman.. 03/12/2025\n\n""}, {""url"": ""https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:tzoxs6ii6u6p24bjzz2kozxn&cid=bafkreifhburner5rwokd6pefiz2otfenjjafebznjphwqmcxjkdh6o6dru"", ""local_path"": ""/images/666242363632_1.jpg"", ""alt"": ""Day 3 Outlook Image""}]"

All severe\nhazards are possible, including swaths of intense winds and\ntornadoes.\n\n...MS/Lower OH/TN Valleys...\n\nA large cyclone will rapidly intensify as it lifts northeast across\nthe central Plains to the Upper Midwest on Friday. A 100+ kt\nsouthwesterly jet streak at 500 mb will overspread portions of the\nOzarks/Mid-MS Valley, while a 60-70 kt low-level jet overspreads\nmuch the Mid-South and Mid-MS/Lower OH Valleys during the late\nafternoon into the overnight hours. Northward extent of deeper Gulf\nmoisture (60s F dewpoints) will likely remain south of southeast\nMO/southern IL/western KY, with more modest 50s F dewpoints\nexpanding northward into southeast MN/southern WI and eastward\ntoward the Lower OH Valley. Despite the more modest moisture across\nthe northern half of the outlook area, cold temperatures aloft will\nsupport steep midlevel lapse rates and at least weak instability. \n\nA strongly forced QLCS is expected to develop along a surface\ndryline as the mid/upper jet impinges on the Ozarks vicinity by late\nafternoon or early evening. Intense forcing and deep-layer wind\nfields will maintain an organized QLCS into the nighttime hours.\nStrong daytime heating and mixing of the boundary layer ahead of the\nQLCS will further promote swaths of severe/damaging gusts, some of\nwhich may be greater than 65 kt. While moisture will be somewhat of\na limiting factor, QLCS tornadoes also will be possible.\n\nConvection may develop later across AR into the TN Valley/Deep\nSouth. However, deeper Gulf moisture will be in place across this\nregion (possible mid/upper 60s F). This will support stronger\ninstability amid supercell wind profiles. Large-scale ascent will be\nmore subtle across this area, but sharpening of the dryline across\nAR and low-level confluence should support convective development\nduring the evening. Initial supercells may grow upscale into a line\nmoving across portions of AR/TN/northern MS/AL. An attendant risk of\nstrong tornadoes and swaths of damaging/potentially significant wind\ngusts is expected across the Mid-South with this activity.\n\nA more conditional risk for overnight supercells exists across parts\nnorthern/central MS/AL. The environment could support intense\nsupercells capable of producing large hail and strong tornadoes this\nfar south, but forcing mechanisms will be weak. Trends will be\nmonitored and future outlook adjustments may be needed.\n\n..Leitman.. 03/12/2025\n\n""}, {""url"": ""https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:tzoxs6ii6u6p24bjzz2kozxn&cid=bafkreifhburner5rwokd6pefiz2otfenjjafebznjphwqmcxjkdh6o6dru"", ""local_path"": ""/images/666242363632_1.jpg"", ""alt"": ""Day 3 Outlook Image""}]"

Despite the more modest moisture across\nthe northern half of the outlook area, cold temperatures aloft will\nsupport steep midlevel lapse rates and at least weak instability. \n\nA strongly forced QLCS is expected to develop along a surface\ndryline as the mid/upper jet impinges on the Ozarks vicinity by late\nafternoon or early evening. Intense forcing and deep-layer wind\nfields will maintain an organized QLCS into the nighttime hours.\nStrong daytime heating and mixing of the boundary layer ahead of the\nQLCS will further promote swaths of severe/damaging gusts, some of\nwhich may be greater than 65 kt. While moisture will be somewhat of\na limiting factor, QLCS tornadoes also will be possible.\n\nConvection may develop later across AR into the TN Valley/Deep\nSouth. However, deeper Gulf moisture will be in place across this\nregion (possible mid/upper 60s F). This will support stronger\ninstability amid supercell wind profiles. Large-scale ascent will be\nmore subtle across this area, but sharpening of the dryline across\nAR and low-level confluence should support convective development\nduring the evening. Initial supercells may grow upscale into a line\nmoving across portions of AR/TN/northern MS/AL. An attendant risk of\nstrong tornadoes and swaths of damaging/potentially significant wind\ngusts is expected across the Mid-South with this activity.\n\nA more conditional risk for overnight supercells exists across parts\nnorthern/central MS/AL. The environment could support intense\nsupercells capable of producing large hail and strong tornadoes this\nfar south, but forcing mechanisms will be weak. Trends will be\nmonitored and future outlook adjustments may be needed.\n\n..Leitman.. 03/12/2025\n\n""}, {""url"": ""https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:tzoxs6ii6u6p24bjzz2kozxn&cid=bafkreifhburner5rwokd6pefiz2otfenjjafebznjphwqmcxjkdh6o6dru"", ""local_path"": ""/images/666242363632_1.jpg"", ""alt"": ""Day 3 Outlook Image""}]"

Isolated severe activity may persist as far\neast as western Mississippi by Thursday morning.\n\n...Synopsis...\nAn upper-level low will eject across the southern Plains today with\na belt of strong mid-level westerly flow across Texas and Louisiana.\nIn response, a surface low will develop across western Texas and\nOklahoma with increasing southerly flow and moisture return across\nTexas into Oklahoma and into the lower Mississippi Valley ahead of\nthe dryline/front.\n\nInitially, low levels will remain strongly capped during the\nday/early afternoon, thereby inhibiting convection. As the mid-level\nlow approaches, cooling aloft will steepen lapse rates and lead to\nincreasing instability. As forcing overspreads the dryline/cold\nfront, isolated to scattered thunderstorm development will be\npossible across portions of southeastern Oklahoma, southern\nArkansas, and northern Louisiana with the potential for damaging\nwinds and large hail.\n\n...Northeast TX...Southeast OK...Southern AR...Northern LA...\nAs the surface low tracks eastward, upper-level flow will overspread\nthe dryline/cold front across southeastern Oklahoma into northeast\nTexas. Models are in agreement that dew points in the upper 50s to\n60s will reach the Red River by around 00z. Sounding profiles\nindicate that a strong capping inversion will remain in place for\nmost of the morning and afternoon, with potential for strong daytime\nheating and mixing that may lower dew points. Regardless, it appears\nthat MUCAPE aloft around 1000-1500 J/kg will develop above this, and\nthat convective development should occur by the later\nafternoon/evening. Though there is some uncertainty on coverage,\ndeep layer shear around 45-55 kts and steep lapse rates would\nsupport organized supercells with potential for very large hail and\ndamaging winds. The large hail threat remains most likely where\nsupercells can develop from northeast Texas into southeastern\nOklahoma, where forcing will intersect the dryline/cold front. This\nis further supported by signal for development in most CAM guidance\nas well as ensemble guidance from HREF, which develops UH tracks\nacross this region and has signal in paint balls for >40 dbz\ndevelopment.\n\nAs convection continues to develop and move eastward with time, some\nupscale growth will be possible. The threat will likely transition\nto primarily damaging wind into portions of southern Arkansas and\nMississippi before storms weaken in the less favorable air mass.\n\n..Thornton/Goss/Squitieri.. 03/12/2025\n\n""}, {""url"": ""https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:tzoxs6ii6u6p24bjzz2kozxn&cid=bafkreicvpev4qdfiz7pq47lqvvg7tvbjkxbo6b4r7hs556uulad3b75asq"", ""local_path"": ""/images/66624235772_1.jpg"", ""alt"": ""Day 1 Outlook Image""}]"

The ResilientMass plan identifies key risks for the state that are projected to increase in intensity and frequency due to climate change, particularly rising temperatures, increases in precipitation and resulting flooding even in areas outside the 100-year floodplain, coastal flooding, and severe weather. These hazards pose significant risks to MA, including coastal erosion, coastal flooding and sea level rise, extreme storms, riverine and urban flooding, increasing high heat events, and wildfire.\n\nRisks are not limited to coastal flooding, though coastal risks are significant with about 43% of the Commonwealth\u2019s population residing in coastal communities, with populations expected to increase, and current annual average damage to coastal buildings in MA at $185M (with this projected to double by 2030). Riverine and inland flooding is an increasing problem in places long since thought to be safe from flooding. A May 2010 storm caused widespread basement flooding and triggered a federal disaster declaration; 90% of claims in MA were outside a mapped flood zone. The 2022 MA Climate Assessment identified \u2018Damage to Inland Buildings\u2019 from heavy rainfall and overwhelmed drainage system as one of the most urgent infrastructure- related climate impacts, with inland residential property damage projected to increase by 44% by 2050.\n""}]"
