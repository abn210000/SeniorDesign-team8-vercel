Glen Izett of the USGS commented on a period of relative quiet lasting three hours, potentially signaling a more intense phase to come.

Initially, this\nactivity will pose a risk for large large hail.  A few tornadoes are\nalso possible, before damaging wind gusts become the more prominent\npotential severe hazard this evening into tonight.\n\n...Discussion...\nTo the north of an intense, zonal jet across the southern\nmid-latitude eastern Pacific, a significant mid-level low is\nforecast to progress slowly eastward across the northeastern\nPacific, toward the Pacific Northwest coast, accompanied by a deep\noccluded surface cyclone.  This has been preceded inland by a series\nof less prominent perturbations, a couple of which may be\nconsolidating into more notable larger-scale mid-level troughing to\nthe east-northeast of the southern Rockies.\n\nModels continue to indicate that this evolving mid-level wave will\naccelerate into a broadly confluent regime across the Ohio Valley\nthrough lower Great Lakes region, between a significant short wave\ntrough digging across Manitoba/Ontario and downstream ridging\noverspreading the St. Lawrence Valley/Northeast.  Models suggest\nthat an associated surface low, likely initially over eastern Iowa\nat the outset of the period, will continue an east-northeastward\nmigration into and across the Great Lakes, but it may not undergo\nsubstantive further deepening until late this afternoon into tonight\nacross the lower Great Lakes into southeastern Ontario/southwestern\nQuebec.\n\nTrailing this cyclone, a notable cold front is forecast to progress\nsoutheastward through the southern Great Plains, and eastward\nthrough the mid/lower Mississippi Valley and middle Ohio Valley by\nlate tonight.  The front will continue to be preceded by a\nmoistening southerly return flow, which may include surface dew\npoints increasing through the lower/mid 60s F as far north as\nsouthern portions of the Great Lakes region, at least initially\nbeneath a remnant plume of elevated mixed-layer air emerging from\nthe high plains.\n\n...Ohio Valley into southeastern Great Plains...\nModels suggest that thermodynamic profiles will become supportive of\nsizable conditional and convective instability, with a fairly broad\nreservoir of CAPE in excess of 2000 J/kg evolving across the\nsoutheastern Great Plains through lower Mississippi Valley, as far\nnorth as the confluence with the Ohio River by late this afternoon. \nFarther north, mixed-layer CAPE is likely to increase in excess of\n1000 J/kg during the day, within a narrower corridor\nacross/north-northeast of the middle Mississippi Valley, where\nmid/upper forcing for ascent is likely to initiate intensifying\nthunderstorm activity by early to mid afternoon.  This may include a\nfew supercells posing a risk for large hail and potential for a\ncouple of tornadoes, before convection tends to gradually\nconsolidate and grow upscale, accompanied by increasing risk for\ndamaging wind gusts.\n\nThis initial activity may be maintained northeastward and eastward\nthrough much of the Ohio Valley by late this evening, before tending\nto weaken while acquiring less unstable inflow.  Meanwhile,\nsubsequent initiation of storms is likely southwestward ahead of the\ncold front, across the lower Ohio Valley/Mid South toward the\nArk-La-Tex later this afternoon into this evening.  It appears\npossible that this may coincide with strengthening\nlower/mid-tropospheric flow accompanying a trailing jet streak.  And\na period of intensifying discrete supercell development might not be\nout of the question, before activity tends to grow upscale into one\nor more organizing clusters.  Depending on how quickly this occurs,\nthere may be a conditional risk for a couple of strong tornadoes,\nbefore damaging straight line winds, and perhaps brief tornadoes\nwith evolving near-surface meso vortices, becomes the more prominent\nhazard southeastward into the Gulf Coast states overnight.\n\n...Florida Peninsula vicinity...\nHREF and NCEP SREF guidance indicates rather high probabilities for\nthunderstorm development, as weak mid-level troughing overspreads\nthe peninsula today.  Beneath modestly cool mid-level temperatures,\nit appears that boundary-layer moisture will support moderate CAPE,\nand thermodynamic profiles may become conducive to a few stronger\nstorms with small, melting hail contributing to potential for\nlocalized damaging downbursts.\n\n..Kerr/Weinman.. 03/30/2025\n\n""}, {""url"": ""https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:tzoxs6ii6u6p24bjzz2kozxn&cid=bafkreietifuezauurgkwucbtx6x4ejljci3ymz6zvkds6u3jgusbxsk5rm"", ""local_path"": ""/images/6662423452_1.jpg"", ""alt"": ""Day 1 Outlook Image""}]"

A\nprominent/initial wave is forecast to shift into the\ncentral/northern Plains overnight, evolving into a closed low over\nthe South Dakota/Nebraska area.  In response, a surface low over the\ncentral High Plains early in the day is forecast to deepen/shift\nnortheastward into the Mid Missouri Valley area overnight.  A\ntrailing cold front will shift across the central and southern\nPlains through the second half of the period.\n\nDiurnal convection ahead of the advancing upper system, and\nattendant cold front, should remain largely suppressed through the\nday by stout capping.  A dryline storm or two cannot be ruled out, \nand very limited/conditional potential for hail or a damaging gust \nmay exist across southern Oklahoma south into central Texas.\n\nGreater risk will evolve overnight, mainly with elevated storms near\nand north of a warm front lifting across Kansas/Missouri.  Large\nhail would be the primary risk in this area, with shear favoring\nsupercells.  While the NAM hinders convection south of Kansas\nthrough the period (due to maintenance of a capping inversion), both\nthe GFS and ECMWF suggest that isolated storms may initiate along\nthe cold front.  While only MRGL risk will be included at this time,\ndue to the conditional risk for surface-based/all-hazards risk\nshould storms develop along the front, this will need to be\nreassessed in later outlooks with possible SLGT risk upgrade.\n\n..Goss.. 03/30/2025\n\n""}, {""url"": ""https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:tzoxs6ii6u6p24bjzz2kozxn&cid=bafkreiadmhjv3du2cxcysi3bqwfkog5sfesyefsr2qqrc622d5hitr44jy"", ""local_path"": ""/images/666242362_1.jpg"", ""alt"": ""Day 3 Outlook Image""}]"
