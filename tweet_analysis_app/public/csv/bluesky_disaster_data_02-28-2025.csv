That includes himself as well as the seasonal workers \u2014 \""the backbone of the workforce,\"" according to Ross. But when asked how many are left on the team after widespread terminations within federal lands agencies over President's Day weekend, Ross doesn't hesitate. The answer is one.\nRoss worked as a wilderness manager for Washington's Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, coordinating maintenance for over 600 miles of trails. Thirteen projects had been planned for 2025, among them fixing up what he calls the gnarliest section of the 2,650-mile-long Pacific Crest Trail. The work would have required Forest Service workers to helicopter into the Mica Lake area to clear trails by hand so horses could get through to provide stock support for volunteers to conduct repair work.\nBut the abrupt culling of Ross' team has sent two years of project planning down the drain.""}, {""url"": ""https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:lomo55iobq2k4r6bkbsrtams&cid=bafkreigk2x4wnwb7rvfwvjuwfqktnivqj5tbwgnhhzokabagiq4nuao6be"", ""local_path"": ""/images/55246342_1.jpg"", ""alt"": ""Many biologists were on the verge of carrying out environmental restoration initiatives when the ax fell. A project aimed at trout conservation in a tributary of Montana's West Fork Bitterroot River can no longer move forward. Mariel Leslie, a fisheries biologist who was terminated Feb. 16, was planning to reintroduce beavers and put felled trees into the water to help restore trout habitat. The Trump administration's pause on federal grants in January initially left the service's partner organization, Trout Unlimited, scrambling for funding; then, the recent layoffs depleted the federal staff who would have overseen the project. Now, Leslie worries that the damage to the environment will only increase, with permanent consequences to some of the area's iconic but imperiled wildlife. \""In western Montana, we are heavily reliant on our recreational economy,\"" she said. \""You can't just go anywhere else and catch a westslope cutthroat.\""""}, {""url"": ""https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:lomo55iobq2k4r6bkbsrtams&cid=bafkreiaisz45xfhw7ufsctggsylhxzv5a33nibzmmycuwiztkmq5wmtdiu"", ""local_path"": ""/images/55246342_2.jpg"", ""alt"": ""This kind of backbreaking work forges camaraderie.\nMany described this inherent sense of community as another perk, on top of knowing that they're working toward improving public access to the outdoors as mandated by The National Trails System Act of 1968.\n\""This is a job I absolutely love,\"" Ross said. \""It was stripped away from me by somebody who wasn't even in our organization, let alone in the chain of command.\""\nRundown outdoor spaces can threaten the safety of recreational users and even nearby communities. For example, trail managers typically dig new latrines before the existing ones overflow. Near Colchuck Lake in the Enchantments area of Washington, local Forest Service personnel fly out up to 10,000 pounds of excrement annually, according to one forestry technician, who was fired on Feb. 14. Otherwise, that human waste would contaminate the Wenatchee River, one of the main sources of drinking water for the nearby town of Leavenworth.""}, {""url"": ""https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:lomo55iobq2k4r6bkbsrtams&cid=bafkreictbkllyqt2phegedblgcy3ej3zaf3psxfqwxjtuhu63q7maawfwu"", ""local_path"": ""/images/55246342_3.jpg"", ""alt"": ""\""There is absolutely no way, with my position being eliminated, for somebody else to step into that role.\""\n\n\nDismissed Forest Service workers are not simply accepting their fate. Many are speaking out publicly and fighting to get back to work. Soon after Trump and DOGE announced the cuts, labor unions representing several agencies, including the Forest Service, promptly filed lawsuits in federal court against what they called \""illegal\"" terminations. A judge has denied one of the suits; in another legal challenge, a judge in California ruled in favor of the unions that the mass firings were unlawful.""}]"

I could like listen to you talk about archives all day, 'cause like this was just really delightful to listen to. (Diamond laughing) But very much so. I think coming into college, I, as a teenager, I experienced forced institutionalization for being Mad and a sort of lifetime of medical and psychiatric abuse prior to and subsequent to that. And I was trying to figure out the way I was going to relate to this sort of language that had been used, both as an excuse and as violation in and of itself toward me. And I couldn't go so far as to disavow it because that would be proving the powers that be right. And I couldn't embrace it because, you know, obviously I'm not gonna do that. And so, obviously I learned that the word I should use for this is disidentification when I first read Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz. \n\nBut around that same time, I was also getting super, super theory-headed in my freshman year of college. And, reading Mu\u00f1oz, reading Foucault, reading Spillers, reading Hartman, reading Moten, reading all of these people who all were talking about the same thing\u2014and that is whatever violations power attempts to make, those violations are immense, but they're never totalizing.

And there are words and there are linguistic turns of phrase that are only able to be thought about in very particular ways. And that's of course a way of narrowing the forms of thought that are allowed. And therefore, like the possibilities of resistance.\n\nBut as someone who is not\u2026 I mean, we're getting closer and closer, but we're not quite here. And by here, I'm pointing to the cover of my very scary book. (Diamond chuckles) We still have the ability to a degree to think, to think at the frayed edges and the borders of power, to think at the edges of legibility and common sense.\n\nAnd all of these writers that I was reading were kind of talking about how do we step beyond this or how do we at least peek? And so I'm interested in thinking about what is archive, thinking about what is sensical, what is history, what is normal. \n\nIn being like, okay, what if we just rip that? Like these stickers here (Cavar grabs a set of stickers from the table). There's wax paper and then there's plastic. And so what if we just do this? You know what I mean? For the audio people, I'm peeling the sticker off of the wax.\n\nAnd so I'm thinking about how to write a book about archives and about memory that does that.""}]"

Maybe it started with a Florida child's distant view of the Shuttle's vapor trail. Maybe it started even earlier with the Greek and Roman myths that various space programs borrowed names from. However it happened, Dane grew up believing that, like those ancient stories of striving heroes and lessons learned, our space program represented some of the best of what humanity could do and be.\nFor this series, Dane took inspiration from an older style than the atomic era MCM he often uses for his space related art. This series is about celebration, wonder, and achievement. With Art Nouveau's innate love of symbolism and heavy use of mythology, the style was a natural choice.\nCelebrating the Mercury Program\nThe first US human spaceflight program, Project Mercury was named for the Roman god of messages and travelers. With the goal to send a human into the void of space and back to Barth safely, the project ran from 1958 to 1963.\nAs an embodiment of the program, Mercury wears the wings of the Roman god for whom she was named and cradles the first American rocket to convey humans to space. Above her, we see both rockets used by the program and six stars (representing six successful human flights). Below her, a medallion showing the titan Atlas holding the globe represents the second American rocket used for human flight. The palm fronds are symbols of both the deity Mercury and of Florida, where the crewed Mercury flights were launched.\nThis giclee print is an easily frameable 13x19 inches.
