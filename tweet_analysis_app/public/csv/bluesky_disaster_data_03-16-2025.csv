As this feature ejects into\nCanada, the primary focus for organized deep convection will shift\nsouth across the Middle Atlantic/Carolinas, in response to a\nlow-latitude speed max that will translate through the base of the\nlong-wave trough into this portion of the CONUS. A notable frontal\nsurge is occurring across the northeast Gulf Basin, and low-level\nflow is beginning to veer across GA into western SC. This synoptic\nfront will be the primary demarcation for organized\nconvection/severe potential the rest of tonight. Over the last few\nhours, there appears to be some propensity for a gradual uptick in\nconvection across the southern Middle Atlantic/coastal SC. This\nactivity should spread northeast within a strongly sheared\nenvironment characterized by modest buoyancy and steep mid-level\nlapse rates. Damaging winds are the main threat, though some tornado\nrisk continues given the strong shear and embedded supercell\nstructures.\n\n..Darrow.. 03/17/2025\n\n""}, {""url"": ""https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:tzoxs6ii6u6p24bjzz2kozxn&cid=bafkreigctgym5n3bvb4awwogunvhcwili2bb4v22yghn4laaik47sc2wxu"", ""local_path"": ""/images/6662423552_1.jpg"", ""alt"": ""Day 1 Outlook Image""}]"

As this feature ejects into\nCanada, the primary focus for organized deep convection will shift\nsouth across the Middle Atlantic/Carolinas, in response to a\nlow-latitude speed max that will translate through the base of the\nlong-wave trough into this portion of the CONUS. A notable frontal\nsurge is occurring across the northeast Gulf Basin, and low-level\nflow is beginning to veer across GA into western SC. This synoptic\nfront will be the primary demarcation for organized\nconvection/severe potential the rest of tonight. Over the last few\nhours, there appears to be some propensity for a gradual uptick in\nconvection across the southern Middle Atlantic/coastal SC. This\nactivity should spread northeast within a strongly sheared\nenvironment characterized by modest buoyancy and steep mid-level\nlapse rates. Damaging winds are the main threat, though some tornado\nrisk continues given the strong shear and embedded supercell\nstructures.\n\n..Darrow.. 03/17/2025\n\n""}, {""url"": ""https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:tzoxs6ii6u6p24bjzz2kozxn&cid=bafkreigctgym5n3bvb4awwogunvhcwili2bb4v22yghn4laaik47sc2wxu"", ""local_path"": ""/images/6662423552_1.jpg"", ""alt"": ""Day 1 Outlook Image""}]"
