Multiple jets of fiery orange and yellow magma surge upward from the dark mountainous crater, creating a spectacular display of nature's raw power.\n\nThis visual powerfully illustrates the imagery evoked in the poem about Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull's 2010 eruption. The line \""Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull did awake and bark\"" is vividly represented by these explosive lava plumes. The poem's reference to \""Its icy crown with fire did meld\"" is embodied in the contrast between the dark mountain (representing the glacier-topped volcano) and the intense eruption.\n\nThe \""ash plumes\"" mentioned would emerge from such dramatic activity, eventually spreading across European airspace. This magnificent yet terrifying display of geological force perfectly captures what the poem describes as \""Three moons' wrath\"" \u2013 the sustained eruption that paralyzed air travel and demonstrated nature's capacity to disrupt human systems despite our technological advancement.\n\nImage Source = https://peapix.com/bing/5744""}]"

A swath of showers with\nisolated/embedded lightning is tracking east-northeastward across\nthe Mid-Atlantic ahead of the front this afternoon. A few strong\ngusts (40-50 mph) may accompany this activity as it overspreads\nportions of northeastern NC and southeastern VA -- where continued\ndiurnal heating and steepening low-level lapse rates will aid in\ndownward momentum transport. However, the overall risk of severe\nwind gusts still appears too low for probabilities at this time.\n\n..Weinman.. 03/20/2025\n\n.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1110 AM CDT Thu Mar 20 2025/\n\n...Eastern NC/Southeast VA...\n\nStrong heating ahead of an eastward-developing surface front will\nallow temperatures to continue climbing into the 70s F this\nafternoon. Boundary layer moisture is expected to remain modest,\nwith surface dewpoints generally reaching the mid/upper 50s F in a\nnarrow corridor just as the surface front arrives. Morning balloon\nobservations from GSO, RNK, IAD, and WAL show very dry midlevels as\nwell. While some midlevel moistening will occur as strong midlevel\nsouthwesterlies overspread the region, overall airmass modification\nwill remain poor. MLCAPE values are expected to remain stunted,\ngenerally less than 100-200 J/kg. This may be sufficient for a few\nlightning flashes as convection develops during the mid afternoon\nalong the surface front. A well-mixed boundary layer to near 850 mb,\nwhere 25-40 kt of flow is forecast, is evident in forecast\nsoundings. This may support a few strong gusts to 40 kt, but very\npoor thermodynamic profiles suggest potential for severe\nthunderstorms should remain low, precluding severe probabilities.\n\n""}, {""url"": ""https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:tzoxs6ii6u6p24bjzz2kozxn&cid=bafkreib4fec57ww25s6pr5isxqwlpahfv3soko7fh223ioytc6rmnslotu"", ""local_path"": ""/images/666242362_1.jpg"", ""alt"": ""Day 1 Outlook Image""}]"

But strengthening\nforcing for ascent should support elevated thunderstorms as early as\nSaturday evening across the Ozark Plateau, increasing in coverage\nduring the night. \n\nWithin a predominately westerly mid to upper wind profile, given the\ngeometry of the northern Great Plains shortwave trough, favorable\nspeed shear should exist for at least a few elevated supercells.

Morning balloon\nobservations from GSO, RNK, IAD, and WAL show very dry midlevels as\nwell. While some midlevel moistening will occur as strong midlevel\nsouthwesterlies overspread the region, overall airmass modification\nwill remain poor. MLCAPE values are expected to remain stunted,\ngenerally less than 100-200 J/kg. This may be sufficient for a few\nlightning flashes as convection develops during the mid afternoon\nalong the surface front. A well-mixed boundary layer to near 850 mb,\nwhere 25-40 kt of flow is forecast, is evident in forecast\nsoundings. This may support a few strong gusts to 40 kt, but very\npoor thermodynamic profiles suggest potential for severe\nthunderstorms should remain low, precluding severe probabilities.\n\n..Leitman/Squitieri.. 03/20/2025\n\n""}, {""url"": ""https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:tzoxs6ii6u6p24bjzz2kozxn&cid=bafkreictcrchy5ktrgjzk2s6i5n33d7wknisqbfuwk4c2e3inpdfpzmzhm"", ""local_path"": ""/images/666242343572_1.jpg"", ""alt"": ""Day 1 Outlook Image""}]"

A strong surface low and an attendant cold front are\nexpected to translate east across the upper Great Lakes and\nMid-Atlantic through the day. It its wake, surface ridge will build\nfrom the Gulf Coast into the Midwest with widespread dry conditions\n(15-35% RH) likely to the west of the ridge axis. \n\n...High Plains...\nAcross the Pacific Northwest, an approaching low-amplitude upper\nwave will begin impinging on the northern Rockies, resulting in\nmodest lee troughing along the High Plains. The resultant\nwest/southwesterly downslope flow regime should foster sustained\nwinds between 15-25 mph. Confidence in sustained 20-25 mph winds\nremains highest across northeast NM and into southeast CO and\nadjacent parts of the OK/TX Panhandles, but such winds are also\npossible further south into southwest TX and further north across\nsoutheast WY into the NE Panhandle. Afternoon RH minimums in the\nteens to low 20s, coupled with antecedent dry fuels - especially\nacross NM and TX where precipitation has been minimal - should\nsupport the fire weather concern. Fire weather concerns are possible\nacross parts of east-central CO where dry/downslope conditions are\nexpected, but recent snowfall should limit fuel status. \n\n...Florida...\nDry conditions are expected to persist across much of central and\nsouthern FL ahead of the frontal passage later in the afternoon.\nPre-frontal westerly winds are forecast to increase to near 15 mph\nwith gusts up to 20 mph possible. Forecast high temperatures are\nexpected to approach the 90th percentile for south FL in mid-March,\nwhich when coupled with mid-50s dewpoints, should result in RH\nvalues between 20-35% by peak heating. Despite some rainfall over\nthe past 48 hours, recent fire activity indicates that fuels will\nsupport fire spread. Critical fire weather conditions appear most\nlikely along the southeastern FL coast where conditions are expected\nto be warmest/driest, but may spread further inland and northward\ninto central FL prior to the late-afternoon frontal passage.\n\n...Louisiana Coast and lower MS River Valley...\nNorthwesterly winds near 15 mph are expected through the morning and\nearly afternoon hours in the immediate wake of the cold front across\nthe lower MS River Valley and central Gulf coast. Winds are expected\nto diminish through peak heating as the surface ridge builds in from\nthe west. Consequently, the temporal overlap of breezy winds and RH\nminimums is expected to be limited, though areas of elevated fire\nweather conditions are possible for a couple of hours from the LA\ncoast northeastward along the MS River, including eastern AR where\nnotable fire activity was observed yesterday outside of the heavy\nrain swaths that occurred during the 3/14 to 3/15 period.\n\n..Moore.. 03/20/2025\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov/fire for graphic product...\n\n""}, {""url"": ""https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:k2fukisqf44dwpixh6ezr3n7&cid=bafkreihdm5a7wv56rkgqjihtibwubhdgpg7eyue6yzitovmukjngiypcgu"", ""local_path"": ""/images/2446373352_1.jpg"", ""alt"": ""Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook Image""}]"
